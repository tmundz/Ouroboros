# Ouroboros

## Purpose

I want to develop a simple, straightforward browser. I plan to ping to get users to the suggested websites and retrieve the HTML and CSS.
I want to parse the IP address of the desired website and retrieve the HTML and CSS.
I want to enable the HTML and render the website, even just basic HTML and CSS.
I would appreciate getting the java script, but I will see.
